                    <h1>Brewing Excellence Since 2025</h1>
                    <p>At BeanDream, we're passionate about sourcing the finest beans and crafting
                        unforgettable coffee

                    <h2>From Bean to Brew</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 2010 in Portland, what began as a small roastery has grown into a beloved destination
                        for
                        coffee
                        enthusiasts. Our journey started with a simple mission: to celebrate the art of coffee by
                        honoring
                        traditional methods while embracing innovation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Every batch we roast reflects our commitment to ethical sourcing, sustainable practices, and the
                        relentless
                        pursuit of flavor perfection.
